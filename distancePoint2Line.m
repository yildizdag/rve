function [d, C, t0] = distancePoint2Line(A, B, P, varargin)
% distancePoint2Line  Calculate the distance between a point and a line
%   D = distancePoint2Line(A, B, P) returns the distance from point P to the
%   line through A and B in an N-dimensional space. 
%
%   D = distancePoint2Line(A, B, P, LineType) returns the distance from 
%   point P to 
%   - a line through A and B, 
%   - a ray which starts at A and passes through B, or 
%   - a line segment AB.
%   The definition of distance D depends on LineType, see below.
%
%   [D, C, t0] = distancePoint2Line(A, B, P, ..) returns in addition the 
%   closest point C and the running parameter t0 that defines the intersection  
%   point of the line through A,B and the perpendicular through P. The 
%   definition of closest point depends on LineType, see below. 
%
%   Definitions of distance (D) and closest point (C):
%
%   If LineType is 'line' (the default):
%   - C is the intersection point.
%   - D is the distance from P to closest point C.  
% 
%   If LineType is 'segment', there are two cases:
%   (1) the intersection point is on line segment AB
%       - C is the intersection point, 
%       - D is the distance from P to the closest point C.
%   (2) the intersection point is outside line segment AB
%       - closest point C is the end of the segment,
%       - D is the distance from P to the end of the segment.
%
%   If LineType is 'ray', there are two cases:
%   (1) the intersection point is on the ray through A and B
%       - C is the intersection point, 
%       - D is the distance from P to the closest point C.
%   (2) the intersection point is not on the ray (behind source A)
%       - C is the source at point A,
%       - D is the distance from P to the source at point A.
%
% Inputs:
%   A	     Starting point. N-element vector.
%   B        End point. N-element vector.
%   P        Independent point. N-element vector.
%   LineType Line type definition: 'line' (default), 'segment' or 'ray'.
% 
% Outputs:
%   D        Distance between the independent point and the line, segment or ray. Scalar.
%   C        Point on the line, segment or ray closest to the independent point. N-element vector.
%   t0       Running parameter that defines the intersection point of the line through
% 			 A and B and the perpendicular through P. At point A, t0 = 0. At point B, t0 = 1. Scalar. 
%
% Example:
%    A = [1, 1];
%    B = [5, 4];
%    P = [-1, 2];
%    % To calculate distance from P to line through A and B:
%    [D, C, t0] = distancePoint2Line(A, B, P)
%    % To calculate distance from P to segment AB: 
%    [D, C, t0] = distancePoint2Line(A, B, P, 'segment')
